      <h3>About Racecycle</h3>
      <p>The truth is, the true results of recycling on our planet are not immediate; far from it in fact. Some of us won't even notice the changes in our lifetime! Here at Racecycle, we aim to provide visible, tangible evidence of your efforts going into proper waste disposal and recycling. Compete with friends for points which can be traded in for prizes, ranging from water bottles and T-shirts to tickets across the globe!</p>
